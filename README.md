# MargWebsite

It's the exercise proposed by the author of [Eloquente in JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) in the chapter 20.

It's a simple website than anyone can vandalize (change the frontend source code as pleased). It uses a file server  called *filesever* :) developed in the [same charpter](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#20.3) of the book.

After downloading the code you probably will need to install the *fileserver* npm modules by running:

```bash  
npm i 
```

on the fileserver directory.

Then to launch the server you only need to run the *launch.sh* script:

```
./launch.sh
```

The script will output the url you have to browse to access the website.
